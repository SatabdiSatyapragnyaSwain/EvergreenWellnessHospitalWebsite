            <p>Neurosurgery is a specialized medical field dedicated to diagnosing and surgically treating conditions
                related to the brain, spinal cord, and nervous system. It addresses issues such as brain tumors, spinal
                disc problems, stroke, epilepsy, and nerve injuries. Using advanced techniques like minimally invasive
                surgery and robotics, neurosurgery ensures precision and faster recovery, significantly improving
                patients' quality of life.
